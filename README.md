# Usage

- Run `predict.py` with:
    - the first argument being a path to (an) image(s) which the model will infer on and
    - the second argument being a path to a directory to which the models predictions will be saved.
- Expects yolov5 in root dir by default. If yolo is installed in another location, use `--yolov5_path`
